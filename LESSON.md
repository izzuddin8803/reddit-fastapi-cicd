## üìù Detailed Lesson Notes

### ‚úÖ Lesson 3.1: GitHub Actions Basics - COMPLETED

#### What We Built:
Created a comprehensive CI pipeline in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that:

1. **Triggers**: Runs on push to main, pull requests, and manual dispatch
2. **Matrix Testing**: Tests on Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11
3. **Dependency Caching**: Speeds up builds by caching pip dependencies
4. **Code Quality**: Runs flake8, black, and mypy checks
5. **Testing**: Executes pytest with coverage reporting
6. **Artifacts**: Uploads test coverage reports

#### Key GitHub Actions Concepts Learned:

**Workflow Structure:**
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline           # Workflow name (appears in GitHub UI)
on: [triggers]             # When to run
jobs:                      # What to run
  job_name:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Where to run
    steps: [...]           # How to run
```

**Matrix Strategy:**
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: [3.9, 3.10, 3.11]
```
This creates 3 parallel jobs, one for each Python version!

**Caching for Performance:**
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('requirements.txt') }}
```

#### Configuration Files Created:
- `.flake8`: Linting rules and exclusions
- `pyproject.toml`: Black formatting and pytest configuration
- Updated `requirements.txt`: Added dev dependencies

#### GitHub Actions Features Used:
- **actions/checkout@v4**: Gets your code
- **actions/setup-python@v4**: Sets up Python environment
- **actions/cache@v3**: Caches dependencies
- **actions/upload-artifact@v3**: Saves test reports

#### What Happens When CI Runs:
1. Code is checked out from repository
2. Python environment is set up
3. Dependencies are installed (with caching)
4. Code quality checks run (flake8, black, mypy)
5. Tests execute with coverage
6. Results are uploaded as artifacts

#### Next Steps:
- Commit and push to trigger first CI run
- Watch the Actions tab in GitHub
- Fix any issues that arise
